            <h3>9-6-2024 - Traffic modelling - part 1</h3>

            <p>I've been rather curious about these for a few months; I have to cross traffic when leaving the office.
                Depending on
                traffic flow, there are clumps of cars followed by sizeable gaps. I was curious what kind of
                distribution those gaps
                followed - how large are they, on average, and how does their size relate to their frequency?</p>

            <p>While walking to the supermarket, I walked along a road, and had some time to consider this further. I
                considered
                using some footage to analyze these things, when I realized that footage is usually from highways, where
                that
                doesn't occur. Why not? I think it's because you have easy passing. That implies that the reason they
                form in
                municipal traffic is because cars can't easily pass each other.</p>

            <p>At that point, the answer is rather simple. Suppose we have a group of <span>$N$</span> cars - perhaps
                released in
                one batch from a traffic light. That directly implies there is some gap between successive traffic light
                activations, but let's ignore that for now - it averages out either way for longer stretches; it's
                simply convenient
                to have some large-but-finite population <span>$N$</span>.</p>

            <p>We have some preferred speed for each car, suppose <span>$v_i$</span>, <span>$i \in N$</span>. The group
                is also an
                ordered set - the cars can't cross each other. At that point, at steady-state - so ignoring acceleration
                etc. - the
                maximum speed of the set <span>$i \in [0, N-1]$</span> is <span>$v_N$</span>: the car at the front
                determines the
                speed for everyone, because nobody can pass. Then, for the set <span>$i \in [0, N-2]$</span>, we have
                <span>$v_{N-1}$</span> as the maximum speed, as long as <span>$v_{N-1} \geq v_{N}$</span>, and so on. I
                guess we can
                write this more compactly as
            </p>

            <p>
                $$ v_{0, \ldots, n}^\text{max} = \text{inf} \{v_{n+1}, v_{n+2}, \ldots, v_N \} $$
            </p>

            <p>with <span>$\text{inf}$</span> the infimum: the smallest element in the set. At that point,</p>

            <p>
                $$ v_0^\text{max} = \text{inf} \{v_1, \ldots, v_N\} $$
            </p>

            <p>We can now also easily describe the batching behavior: for any car <span>$i$</span>, we have a batch for
                <span>$i-1,
                    i-2, \ldots$</span> if <span>$v_{i-1} \geq v_i$</span>, <span>$v_{i-2} \geq v_i$</span> etc. At that
                point, the
                cars will remain at the same speed as <span>$i$</span>, because they can't pass. We can then consider a
                batch as any
                set where the greatest element of the set (i.e. the front-most car, so the largest <span>$i$</span>)
                also satisfies
            </p>

            <p>
                $$ v_i = \text{inf} \{v_i, v_{i-1}, \ldots \} $$
            </p>

            <p>That is - if the front-most car is also the slowest in the set, that set forms a batch. If some car is
                even slower,
                that car will form a new batch (possibly consisting of just that car, if <span>$i = 0$</span>).</p>

            <p>At that point, what determines <span>$v_i$</span>? That'd be the preferred speed in something like the
                intelligent
                driver model. Those are very easy - we coded one before in <span>C++</span>. Is there data on the
                preferred speed?
                Suppose we have a maximum speed <span>$v^\text{max}$</span> - I would assume most people drive just
                below or at the
                speed limit, a few above, some below, with a non-zero probability of zero speed associated with
                breakdowns. To
                measure this, we could simply take the first car of any given batch.</p>
