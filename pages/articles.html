            <h2>16-8-2023 - Inflatable tube man dynamics</h2>
            
            I saw one of these somewhere last week, and got curious. I previously realized the mechanism is simple; we blow in air
            through the bottom, of course. At that point, the tube buckles, creating a constriction, where air pressure increases
            until it reinflates. I went into a fair bit more depth last week, and made some notes in the small notebook. I will work
            those out here.
            
            I think we can consider three distinct phases during normal operation: a buckled stage, where a constriction has formed,
            followed by a period of rising, where the constriction moves upwards, and finally a point where the tube is fully
            opened. We can then clearly see the mechanism; when the top of the tube is closed, the internal pressure is sufficient
            to provide support to the weight of the material. We can assume it has zero stiffness to make things easier.
            
            We can now directly see three operating regimes for the air flow. First, if the velocity is below a certain lower
            critical limit, even when the tube is buckled, the flow won't cause full inflation. This regime would be present even at
            higher velocities if we assume the tube is at least partially permeable, so air can escape through it, but let's assume
            it's impermeable for now. Second, the regular operating regime; when buckled, there is enough pressure to inflate it all
            the way until it's fully vertical and opens up, but not enough to keep it inflated past that point. Third, for a
            velocity far greater than the critical regime, we would get inflation simply due to air drag; we blow the air so fast
            that the drag on the inside is sufficient to lift up all the tube's weight.
            
            Let's consider these. The second regime is the easiest; at any time before the tube opens, we assume the internal
            velocity to be negligible, so that all upwards force results from the air pressure on the horizontal part of the tube,
            so the buckled area. The minimum pressure is then
            
            $$ p_\text{min} = \frac{mg}{A_h} = \frac{\rho_A \cdot 2 \pi r Lg}{\pi r^2} = \frac{2 \rho_A g L}{r}
            $$
            
            with $m$ the mass of the tube and $A_h$ the horizontal area, which we can assume to be equal to the area of the tube, if
            the buckling closes it off fully. I realized we can also express $m$ in terms of the radius, using the area density
            $\rho_A$. That is funny; the mass of the tube scales $\propto r$, because of the circumference, but the total vertical
            pressure with $r^2$, so a wider tube would require less pressure.
            
            Could we do something similar for the case where we do have significant air velocity? We would need to use skin drag
            there, and with realistic radii, definitely the turbulent case. Wikipedia helpfully refers to Anderson's
            \textit{Introduction to Flight} here.\cite{Anderson2016} We have
            
            $$ C_f = \frac{0.074}{\text{Re}_L^{0.2}}
            $$
            
            We then have
            
            $$ q_\infty = \frac{1}{2} \rho_\infty V_\infty^2 \qquad D_f = q_\infty S C_f
            $$
            
            for a plate of unit width and length $L$. Does that generalize to a tube? Let's assume $r$ is sufficient that we can
            approximate the tube as a plate here. We can then modify the equations to
            
            $$ F_d = \frac{1}{2} \frac{0.074}{\text{Re}_L^{0.2}} \rho_\infty V_\infty^2 A = \frac{1}{2}
            \frac{0.074}{\text{Re}_L^{0.2}} \rho_\infty V_\infty^2 A
            $$
            
            It's nice to have these closed-form solutions at times. Actually - we can simplify it considerably by dropping Reynolds.
            After a closer inspection - we could, but it'd be a mess because we have $\text{Re}^{0.2}$. Let's just keep it like
            this. We then require this to be able to keep up our previous mass. We can drop $A$ on both sides there. We then end up
            with
            
            $$ v_\text{min} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \rho_A g \text{Re}_L^{0.2}}{0.074 \rho_\infty}}
            $$
            
            This makes sense, I would say; increasing the area density of the tube, the gravity, or Reynolds (not sure about the
            intuition there) increases the minimum velocity; increasing $\rho_\infty$ decreases it.
            
            Can we somehow relate $p_\text{min}$ to $v_\text{min}$? I doubt it; we're considering two different regimes there. I
            would need to do CFD to determine how they relate exactly. For now, we can just assume that in the buckled state, the
            pressure has to be sufficient to be able to open it fully, while in the unbuckled state, the velocity has to be below
            $v_\text{min}$ to let it buckle again.
            
            Let's now consider the transient behavior. Suppose we are in the final stage; the tube just opened. We clearly have $p
            \geq p_\text{min}$, because the tube opened. Let's consider the use of $v < v_\text{min}$, otherwise we already know
                what happens. At $t=t_0$, the buckling opens. We know $p_\text{internal}> p_\text{external}$, otherwise it wouldn't
                have inflated. Therefore, we have the air flowing out. Suppose we are at $p = p_\text{min}$. Then, at $t_0$, the
                tube looses structural integrity; it will start to fall. How will that proceed?
            
                This depends on the fluid's behavior again. To simplify things, let's continue assuming the tube has no stiffness
                (this seems reasonable), and for ease of argument, that we can consider the vertical behavior of each infinitesimal
                segment as separate from the others, at least in the $\hat {\mathbf z}$ direction; we also neglect the tensile
                strength there. As long as none of the pieces fall significantly faster than the others, that would make sense; the
                forces wouldn't make a difference there either way, then.
            
                We then have two characteristic times. First - the rate at which the air inside the tube reaches equilibrium,
                $\tau_\text{fluid}$. We are still flowing air through the compressor, so the pressure will never fully equalize, but
                we can define this as the internal pressure dropping to a level significantly below $p_\text{min}$, to the point
                where it has limited influence. Second - the time for the tube to fall to the ground, $\tau_\text{collapse}$.
            
                Suppose the fluid instantly equilibriates, throughout the entire length of the tube. That corresponds to
                $\tau_\text{fluid} \ll \tau_\text{collapse}$. At that point, the tube instantly loses structural integrity, and
                starts to collapse. We assume each part does this separately, at the same rate, so the shape of the tube is
                maintained; if it was at a certain angle initially, it will remain at that angle. Each individual part may
                accelerate, but their relative vertical velocities will remain the same.
            
                On the other extreme, we have $\tau_\text{fluid} \gg \tau_\text{collapse}$. In that case, parts of the tube will
                start falling while others are still supported by the internal pressure. We would see curvature then; eventually,
                all regions reach $p < p_\text{min}$, but the top would already have fallen further than the bottom parts. If
                    $\tau_\text{fluid} \approx \tau_\text{collapse}$, we see behavior somewhere in between this; the tube would show
                    some curvature. Now, it's difficult to anticipate $\tau_\text{fluid}$ without CFD. However, we can say something
                    about $\tau_\text{collapse}$ here. Assuming $\rho_A$ is low and $r$ is high - which is always met for these
                    things; we don't use a lead tube of a few millimiters wide here, for obvious reasons - the terminal velocity
                    $v_\text{terminal}$ is hit almost instantly. We have $$ v_\text{terminal}=\sqrt{\frac{2 mg}{C_d \rho_\infty
                    A/2}}=\sqrt{\frac{4 \rho_A g}{C_d \rho_\infty}} $$ Here, $A$ is the overall area, of which only half counts for
                    the drag, so I've taken $A/2$ here, hence the 4 in the numerator; two from the drag equation, and two from the
                    $A/2$. We can then replace $m$ with $\rho_A A$. Is this correct? We have no dependence on $r$ here - that is a
                    bit odd. I think it's correct, though, and if we consider the limiting cases, it makes sense. Suppose we use
                    $\rho_A=1$ kg/m$^2$ (I have no clue there), $C_d=1$ and $\rho_\infty=1.3$- we then get a terminal velocity of
                    5.49 m/s. That seems way too high. I think I'm massively overestimating $\rho_A$. It turns out nylon 66, as an
                    example of a textile material, has an area density of 9.5 g/m$^2$.\cite{Ali2022} That is far lower than
                    anticipated. With that, our terminal velocity is 0.54 m/s. That still seems higher than what I would have
                    expected, but let's roll with it for now. How long does it take to reach this terminal velocity? That's a bit
                    difficult; it approaches asymptotically. StackExchange
                    suggests:\footnote{\url{https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/439294/is-there-a-way-to-calculate-the-time-taken-by-a-falling-object-to-reach-terminal}}
                    $$ \tau_\text{terminal}=\frac{v_t}{g} $$ Does that make sense? The unit is is correct, at least, but why is this
                    a reasonable choice? I guess, initially $v_t$ accelerates with $g$, with that effect diminishing over time,
                    until the acceleration tends to zero at infinity. I guess $g$ is the rate at which we approach $v_t$ without any
                    drag effects present, so it make sense there. Bing suggests $$ s=s_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \qquad
                    s/v_0=s_0/v_0 + v_0/v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a/v_0 t^2 $$ where we take $\tau=a/v_0$, so that for $t \to \infty$, the
                    quadratic term dominates, and we find $s/v_0 \approx 1/2 \tau t^2$. I'm not sure that really makes sense,
                    though. I'm also wondering if this makes sense for a case with air drag. Either way - we can see that the
                    terminal velocity is low, and that it would reach it almost instantly. That makes sense intuitively too; we have
                    a low-density, high-area tube here. We then have linear motion. The characteristic collapse time for a
                    particular section is then just $$ \tau_\text{collapse}=\frac{h}{v_\text{terminal}} $$ where $h$ is the height
                    of the current segment, and $h=L$ is the time it would take for the entire tube to collapse. The top would start
                    falling first (because there, the pressure instantly equilibriates), so assuming $\tau_\text{terminal} \approx
                    0$, that means the tube will fall at most that time. At that point, the case that $\tau_\text{fluid} \ll
                    \tau_\text{collapse}$ seems far more likely; we have several seconds for the tube to fall, while air will flow
                    out very rapidly. That would then imply that the tube falls in a roughly straight line Now, one point I haven't
                    considered here yet - around the pressure source, we do have some net velocity. We would then have a pressure
                    gradient, with the difference between the internal and external pressures at a maximum there, as well as surface
                    drag. It would then make sense to consider the tube as two separate regions; one where the source provides a
                    reasonably constant structural integrity. This is mostly based on what I saw; the buckling usually doesn't occur
                    near the bottom, but rather somewhere halfway. The behavior after buckling is quite clear, really; we apply a
                    certain pressure at the source. Would the pressure in the tube change over time? I doubt it. Actually; maybe it
                    would. Consider what we are doing here. We have a tube, with a buckled point somewhere at $h \in [0, L]$. We
                    have a constant pressure source, leading to expansion. It then has to lift up a certain amount of mass, so the
                    range $[h, L]$. That decreases over time, leading to acceleration. We also see that in practice; I believe. Do
                    we have any idea about the buckling itself? Not particularly. I suppose what we have here is the bottom, rigid
                    region, and the top which collapses when $p < p_\text{min}$. That collapse is in a random direction, because the
                    tube moves around a lot. We assume $\tau_\text{fluid} \ll \tau_\text{collapse}$, so the entire upper region of
                    the tube will collapse roughly rigidly too, in one direction, until the intersection between the bottom and the
                    top buckles, and $p> p_\text{min}$ again.
            
                    Can we say something about the characteristic time between those? For the buckling, I suppose we can express it
                    as the volume flowing in (assuming pressure is constant, we can use Bernoulli, I suppose); if we buckle at $h$,
                    we need to fill $(L - h) \pi r^2$ of volume. From Bernoulli, we have
            
                    $$ p + \rho g h + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 = p_\text{source}
                    $$
            
                    We assume we are feeding from some large reservoir here. Is the height term relevant? Probably, I suppose; our
                    velocity isn't that high, I guess. We can approximate the flow velocity from this, and estimate the rate at
                    which we fill up the tube, assuming we buckled at $h$. Actually - aren't we making a mistake here, now? We also
                    need to consider the pressure head from lifting up the mass of the tube, not just the fluid head from $\rho g
                    h$. Suppose we are at $h$. We then need to lift up
            
                    $$ m_\text{tube} = 2 \pi r \rho_A h
                    $$
            
                    Actually - that's incorrect; it's not like we have the tube hanging on the ground. The fluid needs to lift up
                    the entire tube once we're at $h \geq L$; even if the top length hangs straight down, then, it still can't lie
                    on the ground. Let's assume that's the case, or at least that an irrelevant amount of force is contributed by
                    the ground. We then have
            
                    $$ m_\text{tube} = 2 \pi r L \rho_A
                    $$
            
                    so the full mass of the tube being lifted at all times. The potential energy term for Bernoulli is then
            
                    $$ p + \rho g h + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + 2 \pi r L \rho_A g h = p_\text{source}
                    $$
            
                    Now, $h$ varies with time, so depending on how important those two terms are, this equation could be a bit
                    tricky, but let's assume they're not. Alternatively, we can just evaluate the filling velocity at different
                    values of $h \in [0, L]$. We now have
            
                    $$ v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho} \left ( p_\text{source} - p - \rho g h - 2 \pi r L \rho_A g h \right ) }
                    $$
            
                    At that point, the filling time at one particular $h$ (which doesn't make much sense, because that's integrating
                    over $[0, t_\text{filled}]$, unless the $h$ terms are indeed irrelevant, or $h$ itself is constant, which
                    doesn't make sense at all - but let's disregard that for now) is
            
                    $$
                    \begin {split}
                    \tau_\text{filling} &= \frac{(L - h) \pi r^2}{\pi r^2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho} \left ( p_\text{source} - p - \rho g
                    h - 2 \pi r L \rho_A g h \right )}} \\
                    &= \frac{L - h}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho} \left (
                    p_\text{source} - p - \rho g h - 2 \pi r L \rho_A g h \right )}} \\
                    &\approx \frac{L - h}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho} \left (
                    p_\text{source} - p \right )}}
                    \end {split}
                    $$
            
                    Interesting - we know $\rho_A$ is very small, so this again doesn't depend strongly on $r$. Actually; I just
                    thought of something; we have $p_\text{source}$ and $p$ in the order of $10^5$ Pa. Obviously, $\rho g h$ is far
                    less than that. We can then simplify everything even further, and notice that, indeed, the filling time hardly
                    depends on $h(t)$, only on $h(t_0)$.
            
                    Suppose we then know the length of the two sections; we can now estimate the collapse time, then the rise time
                    as well, as well as the regimes where that will happen; we have the minimum pressure and the maximum velocity,
                    where we can relate the latter to pressure using Bernoulli too, I suppose.
